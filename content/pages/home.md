      This project is set up to show you the basics of working with Tina. You're
      looking at the landing page, which pulls content from
      content/pages/home.md, components from components/blocks, and puts them
      all together in pages/\[filename].tsx, all based on a schema defined in
      .tina/schema.ts.
